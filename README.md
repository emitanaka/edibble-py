# edibble-python

This is a work-in-progress Python library that aims to be the Python version of the [`edibble` R package](https://github.com/emitanaka/edibble). 

Please note that the library is not ready at all and won't be likely ready any time soon.

The name of the Python library, like the R version, is "edibble" with the nickname "edibble-py". The icon would be circular and look like a pie.
